                <h2>What or who is a Furry?</h2>
                <p>A furry is a person who has an interest in fictional anthropomorphic animal characters, also known as fursonas. This interest can manifest in a variety of ways, such as creating artwork or writing stories featuring fursonas, participating in online communities centered around the furry fandom, or creating and wearing costumes, known as fursuits, that depict a fursona. Furries often form friendships and communities with other people who share their interest in fursonas, and they may participate in conventions and other events that are organized specifically for the furry community. The furry community is diverse and has wide range of interests and backgrounds. Some furries enjoy creating and sharing art, while others enjoy writing stories or creating costumes. Some focus on specific animal species or types of fursonas, while others have a more general interest in the furry community as a whole.
